# Contributing

First off, thank you for considering contributing to **bemol**.

All type of contributions are welcome (bug fixes, new models, new rotors, 
new reference data, etc).

At the time being the contributing procedure is really straigthforward.

## Steps

0. Make sure you have all the dependencies available in your environment, with
   the same (or similar) version indicated in [environnment.yaml](./environment.yaml).
1. Create an issue indicating the bug you are fixing or the new feature you are
   implementing.
2. Do your magic.
3. Make the pull request for the `dev` branch, with an explanation of what you
   did and ask for a review.

## Style

Style is not strictly enforced, but try to follow [PEP 8](https://peps.python.org/pep-0008/).
When adding new functions and classes always fill a complete docstring using the
[numpydoc](https://numpydoc.readthedocs.io/en/latest/format.html) style.
